# Ansible-Projectutomation and Ansible Learning Project
## OverviMew

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Automation and Ansible. The project is divided into two phases, each designed to build my knowledge and skills in these areas.
## Project Phases
### Phase 1: Following the Tutorial

The first phase involves following a tutorial from the Learn Linux TV YouTube channel. This phase will help me get a solid understanding of the basics of Ansible and how it can be used for automation. The tutorial covers:

    - Introduction to Ansible
    - Installation and Configuration
    - Writing Playbooks and Roles
    - Managing Configurations
    - Automation Best Practices

### Phase 2: Assisting AXA Assurance Algeria

Once I complete the tutorial, the second phase begins. In this phase, I will apply what I've learned to assist the system administrators team at AXA Assurance Algeria with their Ansible deployment project. This will include:

    - Assessing the current environment and identifying automation opportunities
    - Developing and testing Ansible playbooks and roles
    - Assisting with the deployment and configuration of Ansible across their infrastructure
    - Providing documentation and training to the team as needed

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:

    - To gain a thorough understanding of Ansible and its use cases
    - To develop hands-on experience by working on a real-world project
    - To contribute to the successful deployment of Ansible at AXA Assurance Algeria

## How to Use This Repository

This repository will contain:

    Notes and learnings from the Learn Linux TV tutorial
    Ansible playbooks and roles developed during both phases
    Documentation related to the deployment project at AXA Assurance Algeria
